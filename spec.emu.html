title: Uniform parsing of quasi-standard Date.parse input
status: proposal

<emu-clause id="sec-date.parse">
  <h1>Date.parse ( _string_ )</h1>
  <p>The `parse` function applies the ToString operator to its argument. If ToString results in an abrupt completion the Completion Record is immediately returned. Otherwise, `parse` interprets the resulting String as a date and time; it returns a Number, the UTC time value corresponding to the date and time. The String may be interpreted as a local time, a UTC time, or a time in some other time zone, depending on the contents of the String. The function first attempts to parse the String according to the format described in Date Time String Format (<emu-xref href="#sec-date-time-string-format"></emu-xref>), including expanded years. If the String does not conform to that format the function may fall back to any implementation-specific heuristics or implementation-specific date formats. Strings that are unrecognizable or contain out-of-bounds format field values shall cause `Date.parse` to return *NaN*.</p>
  <p>If `x` is any Date object whose milliseconds amount is zero within a particular implementation of ECMAScript, then all of the following expressions should produce the same numeric value in that implementation, if all the properties referenced have their initial values:</p>
  <pre><code class="javascript">
    x.valueOf()
    Date.parse(x.toString())
    Date.parse(x.toUTCString())
    Date.parse(x.toISOString())
  </code></pre>
  <p>However, the expression</p>
  <pre><code class="javascript">
    Date.parse(x.toLocaleString())
  </code></pre>
  <p>is not required to produce the same Number value as the preceding three expressions and, in general, the value produced by `Date.parse` is implementation-dependent when given any String value that does not conform to the Date Time String Format (<emu-xref href="#sec-date-time-string-format"></emu-xref>) and that could not be produced in that implementation by the `toString` or `toUTCString` method.</p>
</emu-clause>
